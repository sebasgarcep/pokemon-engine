# Pokemon Engine

A proper emulation of the Pokemon engine. Its scope will be limited to emulating current VGC format (and perhaps singles as an addendum). The end goal of this engine is to be usable for game simulations in an AI engine. It will be based around immutable data structures to be able to toy with it efficiently.

## Examples: Terminal Game

Using the command `yarn terminal-game` you can play a game against yourself with a preset team.
